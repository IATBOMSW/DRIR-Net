# 📍 DRIR-Net: Dual-Branch Rotation Invariant and Robust Network for 3D Place Recognition

> A robust and rotation-equivariant approach for place recognition in large-scale 3D environments.  

---

## 🌟 Highlights

- ✅ A subregion downsampling method reduces preprocessing time for point clouds
- ✅ The extraction of noise-resistant point features and rotation-invariant descriptors
- ✅ Subregion cross attention fuses point and voxel features with accurate correspondence
- ✅ Superior performance and generalization on multiple 3D place recognition datasets
